    	<h4>Web overview and Assignment</h4>
    	<h5>Date:03/03/2022</h5>

    	<p>It has already been more than 2 months since i joined NAMI(Naya Aayam Multi-Disciplinary Institute) as an IT student. The journey was fascinating as i got learn different topics related to computers. Similarly, web development is the subject which was very interesting as we got to learn how to make a website, how to make forms, how to use grid layouts, what are flex, float and so on. At first it was really difficult for me to understand how to create websites and use CSS properties. But with the help of sir's guidance i was able to learn basic coding.</p>

        <p>Our module leader is Ankit Thapa. The way he teaches us is very professional and easy to understand. He explains each and everything in detail and also help us with the things that we are having difficulty with. He is very calm and patient when it comes to explaining something that we have not understood. Also, without sir guidance it would be not possible for me to complete my assignment before the deadline.</p>
        
       <p> Now I will explain about the design and CSS properties that i have used to complete my assignment. Firstly, we be will talking about my homepage. I kept my homepage simple and minimal and used inline-flex to create my homepage(slides). Secondly, I made a portfolio describing about me and about the things that i love doing. I used two columns where in one column it's about me and in the other column about my skill. I have used light colors and used float properties in my portfolio(slides). Thirdly, I made a contact form where I included first name, last name, email address and so on. While making contact form i just used text-align and text- transform CSS properties(easy webcode,2020). Lastly, I wrote a blog about the things that i have done till now about the progress, ups and downs. While writing my blog i used grid and float CSS properties to complete my blog respectively(slides). I took some coding from youtube and slides to make my homepage, contact form, portfolio and blog the reason why i took help from the website because i was got confused.</p>
