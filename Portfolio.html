        <h1>Hi, my name is Sarita Ghale. i'm a student and currently studying in Nami(Naya Aayam Multi-Disciplinary Institute).My major is IT(Information Technology).
    	There is one thing I lack that is my self confidence in public speaking. This is something I need to work on more and which I'm quite improving after joining this college by delivering presentations on different topics.
    	Apart from this, I decided to pursue Information Technology because I simply want to gain knowledge on this field and interested in learning about security, networks, application, computer and so forth.</h1>
