    	<h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sarita Ghale. I'm a student and currently studying in Nami(Naya Aayam Multi-Disciplinary Institute).My major is IT(Information Technology).
    	There is one thing I lack that is my self confidence in public speaking. This is something I need to work on more and which I'm quite improving after joining this college by delivering presentations on different topics.</p>
 
    	<p>Apart from this, I decided to pursue Information Technology because I simply want to gain knowledge on this field and interested in learning about security, networks, application, computer and so forth.</p>
