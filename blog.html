		<div class="item1"><h1>Day 1</h1>My first task was to create home page. Creating an home page was completely new to me. I was nervous at first, confused, and little afraid as I was having trouble making one and was not sure whether I would be able to complete my tasks by the deadline. However with the help of homepage demonstration on youtube, and information from different sources such as websites, slides I finally succeeded creating homepage.</div>	
		<div class="item2"> <h1>Day 2</h1>My second task was to create a portfolio which is an organized collection of a person's achievement. I attempted to reflect on what I had learned and to show my growth and development. I conducted a lot of study on how to create a portfolio, I learnt its format, going through examples of other people's portfolio, and eventually I completed my own portfolio.</div>
		<div class="item3"><h1>Day 3</h1>We were tasked to create a contact form. So, to complete our task we took a class on this topic from one of our teacher to enhance our understanding and making a note on it, and I created one.</div>

	<h1>Skill</h1>
	<p>I really like to play badminton. In school days I always used to participate in badminton matches and always used to win. Even when I think about badminton it makes me feel so happy</p>
