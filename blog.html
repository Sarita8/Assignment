		<h1>Day 1</h1>
		<div class="item1">My first task was to create home page. Creating an home page was completely new to me. I was nervous at first, confused, and little afraid as i was having trouble making one and was not sure whether i would be able to complete my tasks by the deadline. However with the help of homepage demonstration on youtube, and information from different sources such as websites, slides i finally succeeded creating homepage.</div>
		<h1>Day 2</h1>
		<div class="item2"> My second task was to create a portfolio which is an organized collection of a person's achievement. I attempted to reflect on what i had learned and to show my growth and development. I conducted a lot of study on how to create a portfolio, i learnt its format, going through examples of other people's portfolio, and eventually i completed my own portfolio.</div>
		<h1>Day 3</h1>
		<div class="item3">We were tasked to create a contact form. So, to complete our task we took a class on this topic from one of our teacher to enhance our understanding and making a note on it, i created one without any difficulties.</div>
		<h1>Skills</h1>
